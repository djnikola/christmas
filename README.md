# Christmas

## User story
As a geeky Christmas fan I want to generate ASCII shapes of stars and trees in three different
sizes so that I can decorate my office nicely for Christmas.

## Details
The designer has provided the following designs for the shapes: Tree and Star

The following sizes should be available:
- S (small): 5 lines height
- M (medium): 7 lines height
- L (large): 11 lines height
If the user does not provide a size, pick a random size.
It should be possible to output the shapes both on the command line and in a browser.
